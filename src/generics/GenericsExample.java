 *
 * Generics in Java provide a way to create type-safe code by allowing classes,
 * methods, and interfaces to be parameterized with one or more types. 
 * The main benefit of using Generics is that it allows us to create reusable 
 * code that can work with different types of data.
 * 
 * The basic syntax of using Generics is to define a type parameter using the angle 
 * bracket notation "<>", also known as the diamond operator.

	 * When defining a generic method outside of a class, it is important to use the diamond operator <T>
	 * to specify that the method is generic and can accept any type of object as a parameter. 
	 * By doing this, the method can be called with different 
	 * types of objects and will be able to handle each object correctly based on its specific type.
	 * 
	 * If the diamond operator is not used, the method will not be able to accept different types 
	 * of objects as parameters and will be limited to working with a specific type of object 
	 * that is specified when the method is defined. This can make the method less flexible and 
	 * less useful in situations where you need to work with different types of objects.

	 * We should use printList(List<?> myList) instead of printList(List<Object> myList) because List<?> 
	 * is a wildcard generic type, which means it can accept any type of List regardless of its generic type. 
	 * This makes the printList method more flexible and reusable as it can be used with different types of lists.
	 * 
	 * If we use List<Object> instead, we would be limiting the method to only accept lists of Object type. 
	 * This means that if we try to pass a list of a specific type, such as List<Integer> or List<String>, 
	 * it would not be possible as these lists are not subtypes of List<Object>.
	 * 
	 * 	
	 * For example, if we had used List<Object> instead of List<?>, the following code would not compile:

		printList(myIntList); // This would result in a compile-time error

	 * The difference between the two methods is the type of the argument that they accept.
	 * 
	 * The first method printZoo(List<? extends ZooAnimal> zoo) accepts a list of objects that

	 * It allows the method to accept a list of any type that is a subclass of ZooAnimal, 
	 * providing more flexibility in the types of lists that can be passed to the method.
	 * 
	 * The second method printZoo(List<ZooAnimal> zoo) accepts only a list of objects that are
	 * of type ZooAnimal. This means that it can only accept a list of ZooAnimal objects, 
	 * and not any subclass of ZooAnimal.
	 * 
	 * In terms of the output, both methods will produce the same result since the sound() method 
	 * is defined in the ZooAnimal interface and will be implemented by all subclasses of ZooAnimal. 
	 * However, using the first method with a bounded wildcard can be more flexible and allow for a wider range 
	 * of input types.

	 * In this case, the notation <? super Panda> is a

	 * is either a superclass of Panda, or Panda itself.
	 * 
	 * Since Panda is a child class of Bear, any class that 
	 * is a superclass of Panda is also a superclass of Bear. 
	 * Therefore, <? super Panda> would accept any class that is 
	 * a superclass of Panda, Bear, or any other class that is a superclass of Bear.
	 * 
	 * For example, if we have a class Animal that is a superclass of Bear, then <? super Panda> 
	 * would accept types like Animal, Bear, or Object.
	 * 
	 * The super keyword indicates that the unknown type must be a superclass of Panda, or Panda itself. 
	 * This means that the wildcard type parameter can accept any type that is a superclass of Panda, 
	 * which includes Bear and any other superclass of Panda.
	 * 
	 * Again, the second ? in <? super Panda, ?> is a shorthand notation for <? extends Object>, 
	 * which means any type that extends Object.
	 * 
	 * Overall, the wildcard type parameter <? super Panda> provides flexibility when dealing 
	 * with different types that are either a superclass of, or Panda itself, while still ensuring type safety.
