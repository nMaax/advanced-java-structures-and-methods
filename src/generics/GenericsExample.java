 * Generics in Java provide a way to create type-safe code by allowing classes,
 * methods, and interfaces to be parameterized with one or more types. 
 * The main benefit of using Generics is that it allows us to create reusable 
 * code that can work with different types of data.
 * 
 * The basic syntax of using Generics is to define a type parameter using the angle 
 * bracket notation "<>", also known as the diamond operator.

		 * x.add();

		 * x = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);

		 * But again we could call .add() on it
		 * 
		 * This explains the fact that when we use <?> we know that we are

	 * We should use printList(List<?> myList) instead of printList(List<Object> myList) because List<?> 
	 * is a wildcard generic type, which means it can accept any type of List regardless of its generic type. 
	 * This makes the printList method more flexible and reusable as it can be used with different types of lists.
	 * 
	 * If we use List<Object> instead, we would be limiting the method to only accept lists of Object type. 
	 * This means that if we try to pass a list of a specific type, such as List<Integer> or List<String>, 
	 * it would not be possible as these lists are not subtypes of List<Object>.
	 * 
	 * 	
	 * For example, if we had used List<Object> instead of List<?>, the following code would not compile:
		
		List<Integer> myIntList = new ArrayList<>();
		printList(myIntList); // This would result in a compile-time error
		
		private static void printList(List<Object> myList) {
			System.out.println(myList);
		}

	 * This is because even if Integer is a subtype of Object the class List<Integer> is NOT a subtype of List<Object>. 
	 * By using List<?> instead, we can accept any type of List as long as it is a List	
	 * 
	 * Consider even that 
	   
	  	private static void printList(List<T> myList) {
			System.out.println(myList);
		}
		
	 * is not legal. 
	 * 
	 * In this case the printList method is using a type parameter <T> to specify the type of the List parameter. 
	 * However, in this case, the type parameter is not defined or constrained, so the List could be of any type. 
	 * This would make it similar to the List<?> version. 
	 * But, the problem is that T is not defined or specified anywhere in the method or in the class. 
	 * This means that the compiler cannot infer the type of T, and the method will not compile.
	 * 
	 * When you use T as a type parameter, it means that you are defining a generic type or method that 
	 * can work with any type, but the specific type is determined when the code is compiled or executed. 
	 * For example, if you have a class MyList<T> that implements a generic list, 
	 * you could create a MyList<String> object, which means that T is now String. 
	 * The type parameter T is replaced with the actual type (in this case String) when the code is compiled.
	 * 
	 * On the other hand, when you use ? as a type parameter, it means that you are telling the compiler 
	 * that you don't care about the specific type, only that it is some type. This is often used when you 
	 * want to write code that is generic and can work with different types, but you don't need
	 *  to know the specific type at compile time. For example, if you have a method printList(List<?> list), 
	 *  you can pass in a list of any type, but the specific type is not important because you only need to 
	 *  print the list.
	 * 
	 * In short, both T and ? are generic type parameters, but T is used when you need to define a specific 
	 * type that is determined at compile time, while ? is used when you don't care about the specific type 
	 * and only need to work with any type.
	 * 
	 * The only place where you can use ? is in the declaration of a variable or a parameter to indicate 
	 * that the type is unknown or irrelevant.
